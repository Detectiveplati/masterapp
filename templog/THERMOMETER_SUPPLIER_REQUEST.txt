BLUETOOTH THERMOMETER INTEGRATION REQUEST - SUPPLIER SPECIFICATIONS
============================================================================

Dear [Supplier Name],

We are integrating a Bluetooth-enabled food probe thermometer into a kitchen 
logging application. We need to confirm that your thermometer meets the 
following technical requirements before purchase.

Please provide the following specifications:

1. BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
   - Does the thermometer use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)?
   - Is it compatible with Web Bluetooth API (Chrome/Chromium browsers)?
   - Does it support Android 9+ devices?

2. GATT SERVICE & CHARACTERISTIC INFORMATION
   - What is the Service UUID for temperature data?
   - What is the Characteristic UUID for reading temperature values?
   - What is the data format (float32, int16, custom byte array)?
   - What is the temperature unit (Celsius/Fahrenheit)?
   - What is the temperature range and precision?

3. CONNECTIVITY METHOD
   - Does the thermometer advertise its service without requiring pairing?
   - Or does it require pairing/authentication first?
   - What is the typical connection time?

4. NOTIFICATIONS & UPDATES
   - Does the characteristic support read-only, or also notifications?
   - How frequently does it update temperature (Hz)?

5. DOCUMENTATION
   - Can you provide technical documentation with GATT service details?
   - Do you have sample code for reading temperature via BLE?
   - Is there an SDK or API we can use?

6. DEVICE SPECIFICATIONS
   - Probe type: Food/meat probe
   - Temperature range: 0–100°C (typical kitchen use)
   - Wireless range: Minimum 5 meters
   - Battery life: Minimum 8 hours continuous use
   - Price: Under SGD 100 per unit

7. COMPLIANCE
   - Is it certified for food contact (food-safe probe)?
   - CE/FCC certification for Bluetooth?

Please respond with detailed specifications and, ideally, a link to the GATT 
service documentation or a sample implementation guide.

Thank you,
[Your Name]

NOTES FOR YOUR SUPPLIER:
============================================================================

If they cannot provide GATT UUIDs or documentation, ask:
"Can you provide the Service and Characteristic UUIDs so we can integrate
your thermometer via the Web Bluetooth API in Chrome/Chromium browsers?"

If they don't support Web Bluetooth or GATT, they likely won't work with 
our application. Consider asking if they have an alternative: IoT gateway,
HTTP API, or MQTT integration instead.
